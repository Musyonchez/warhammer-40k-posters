i have a wall in my room that i am printing wh 40k posters in a4 size to stick

the wall takes 13 a4 length and i want 3 down

i have taken up n the legth wise 1st row 9 spaces for the primarchs 1-10 and the 3rd row 9 spaces for primarchs 12- 20   then the emporer takes middle row spot 5

i need to fill the rest

Nice! So you've got a great 13×3 A4 grid for a Warhammer 40k wall display. Let me visualize what you have so far:

Row 1 (Top): Primarchs I-X (9 posters) + 4 empty spaces Row 2 (Middle): 4 empty + The Emperor (center spot) + 4 empty Row 3 (Bottom): Primarchs XII-XX (9 posters) + 4 empty spaces

That gives you 12 empty spots to fill (4 top, 4 middle left/right of Emperor, 4 bottom).

Here are some thematic ideas to fill those gaps:

Imperial/Loyalist themed:

Malcador the Sigillite (Emperor's right hand)
Imperial Aquila symbols
Key chapter symbols (Ultramarines, Blood Angels, Imperial Fists, etc.)
The Golden Throne
Significant Space Marine heroes (Guilliman in armor, Dante, Calgar, etc.)
Chaos/Heresy themed:

The major Chaos Gods (Khorne, Tzeentch, Nurgle, Slaanesh)
Chaos symbols/icons
Abaddon the Despoiler
Key traitor legion symbols
Timeline/Lore themed:

Unification Wars imagery
Great Crusade era scenes
Horus Heresy key moments
The Siege of Terra
Mixed approach:

Balance loyalist chapters on one side, traitor legions on the other
Use the 4 corner spots for the Chaos Gods, middle spaces for Imperial symbols
What aesthetic are you going for? More loyalist/Imperial, balanced, or do you want to represent the tragedy of the Heresy?

the empoer has 12 coz 4 before 4 after and 4 after that

Ah got it! So the Emperor actually has 12 empty spaces around him in the middle row (4 before, 4 after on his row, plus 4 more after that... wait, let me clarify:

Do you mean:

Middle row: 4 empty + Emperor + 8 empty = 13 total
OR are you saying there are additional empty spots I'm not counting correctly?

Let me recount based on your layout:

Row 1 (Top): Primarchs I-X (spots 1-9) = 4 empty spots (10-13) Row 2 (Middle): Emperor at spot 5 (center) = 12 empty spots (spots 1-4 and 6-13) Row 3 (Bottom): Primarchs XII-XX (spots 1-9) = 4 empty spots (10-13)

So 20 total empty spots to fill?

Or did you mean the Emperor's positioning differently? Want to clarify so I can give you the best suggestions for filling all those spaces!

yes

Perfect! So you have 20 empty A4 spots to fill. That's a great canvas to work with!

Here's a thematic breakdown for filling those 20 spaces:

The 4 Chaos Gods (essential for the Primarch story)
Khorne
Tzeentch
Nurgle
Slaanesh
These directly tie into why half the Primarchs fell.

Key Imperial Figures (4-5 posters)
Malcador the Sigillite
Constantin Valdor (Captain-General of Custodes)
Rogal Dorn (if you want him separately as the Praetorian)
A notable Imperial Saint or key figure
Faction Symbols/Heraldry (4-6 posters)
Imperial Aquila
Mechanicus Cog
Inquisition symbol
Major chapter symbols (Ultramarines, Blood Angels, etc.)
Chaos Star/Eye of Terror
Legendary Scenes/Artifacts (4-6 posters)
The Golden Throne
The Siege of Terra
Ullanor Triumph
The Webway War
Key weapons (like the Emperor's Sword)
Balance Option:
Put Chaos Gods in the 4 corners (top/bottom empty spaces), flank the Emperor with his closest allies (Malcador, Valdor on middle row), and use the rest for symbols and key moments.

What's your preference - more characters, more symbols, or more epic scenes/artwork?

wait valdor and malcador who was left and who was right?

In the lore, there isn't a strict canonical "left hand" vs "right hand" designation, but generally:

Malcador the Sigillite is most often referred to as the Emperor's "right hand" - he was the First Lord of Terra, the Emperor's closest confidant, and handled the administrative/political side of the Imperium.

Constantin Valdor was the Captain-General of the Adeptus Custodes and the Emperor's chief protector/warrior, so he'd be more the "left hand" (the sword to Malcador's pen).

So for a symmetrical layout around the Emperor:

Right of Emperor (viewer's left): Malcador
Left of Emperor (viewer's right): Valdor
Though honestly, since it's your wall, you could place them however feels right aesthetically! Some people also consider the Primarchs collectively as his "hands" with these two being his most trusted advisors on Terra itself.

i think then i may have to break this as i want row 2 spot 4 be valdor spot 3 be sisters of silence spot 2 be sisters of battle spot 1 be inquisition

then spot 6 be malcador spot 7 be tech prist spot 8 be grey knight spot 9,10,11,12 be asssins from the main temples.  can give spot 13 to emperor class titan

That's an absolutely brilliant layout! You're creating a perfect representation of the Emperor's organizations and forces. Let me visualize it:

Row 2 (Middle) - The Emperor's Arsenal:

Inquisition
Sisters of Battle (Ecclesiarchy)
Sisters of Silence
Constantin Valdor (Custodes)
THE EMPEROR
Malcador the Sigillite
Tech Priest (Adeptus Mechanicus)
Grey Knights
Assassin (Vindicare?)
Assassin (Callidus?)
Assassin (Eversor?)
Assassin (Culexus?)
Emperor-class Titan
This is chef's kiss - you've got all the major Imperial organizations flanking the Emperor, building from his inner circle (Valdor/Malcador) outward to his secret weapons (Assassins) and ultimate war machine (Titan).

Now for the remaining 8 spots (4 on Row 1, 4 on Row 3):

Suggestions:

The 4 Chaos Gods (corners or all on one row to show the opposition)
Major Chapter/Legion symbols
Key artifacts (Golden Throne, Astronomican, etc.)
Legendary battles/moments
Notable xenos threats (to show what the Imperium fights)
What direction appeals to you for those last 8?

should i place the chaos gods in one line in a row or split 2 row 1 2 below row 2?

I'd recommend splitting them 2 and 2 (2 on Row 1, 2 on Row 3) for these reasons:

Visual balance: It creates symmetry - the Chaos Gods literally flanking the Emperor's forces from above and below, representing the constant threat surrounding the Imperium.

Thematic placement:

Row 1 (Top): 2 Chaos Gods near Primarchs I-X (the loyalists who resisted)
Row 3 (Bottom): 2 Chaos Gods near Primarchs XII-XX (the traitors who fell)
This visually tells the story of Chaos threatening both groups of Primarchs.

Which Gods where? You could do:

Top (Row 1): Khorne & Tzeentch (the more "active" corruptors)
Bottom (Row 3): Nurgle & Slaanesh
Or arrange by the Primarchs they corrupted most notably:

Top: Tzeentch (Magnus) & Khorne (Angron)
Bottom: Nurgle (Mortarion) & Slaanesh (Fulgrim)
Splitting them also leaves you 4 more spots for other content instead of dedicating a whole row to Chaos.

What do you think?

what about a split of spots 10 and 13 on both rows?

That's even better! Spots 10 and 13 on both rows creates perfect corner placement:

Row 1:

Spot 10: Chaos God
Spot 13: Chaos God
Row 3:

Spot 10: Chaos God
Spot 13: Chaos God
Why this works brilliantly:

Corner guards - The Chaos Gods literally frame the entire display at all four corners, representing the omnipresent threat
Maximum separation from Emperor - They're as far from the Emperor (center of Row 2, spot 5) as physically possible on your wall
Clean symmetry - Creates a perfect visual "box" around everything
Leaves spots 11-12 on both rows - That gives you 4 middle spots (Row 1: spots 11-12, Row 3: spots 11-12) for other content right in the center columns
Which God in which corner?

Top-left (R1-S10) & Bottom-right (R3-S13): Could be opposed pairs
Top-right (R1-S13) & Bottom-left (R3-S10): Their counterparts
Classic pairing: Khorne/Slaanesh opposed, Tzeentch/Nurgle opposed

What would you put in those 4 remaining middle spots (11-12 on each row)?

in most 4 in one images its khorne top left tzeeetch top right then nurgle bottom left and slanesh bottom right

Perfect! So following that standard Chaos arrangement:

Row 1 (Top):

Spot 10: Khorne (top-left)
Spot 13: Tzeentch (top-right)
Row 3 (Bottom):

Spot 10: Nurgle (bottom-left)
Spot 13: Slaanesh (bottom-right)
This matches the traditional Chaos wheel positioning and creates the perfect framing for your entire display.

Now for the final 4 spots (11-12 on both rows):

These are right in the center columns, between the Primarchs and Chaos Gods. Some ideas:

Imperial symbols (Aquila, Mechanicus cog, etc.)
Key artifacts (Golden Throne, Astronomican)
Notable heroes/champions (Abaddon, Sigismund, other legendary figures)
Major Legion/Chapter heraldry
Xenos threats (Hive Tyrant, Necron Lord, etc.)
Epic battle scenes (Siege of Terra, Ullanor, etc.)
What vibe do you want for those center spots - more Imperial glory, notable individuals, or something else?

and it should be the order of their births

Ah, you want the Chaos Gods in order of their birth!

In Warhammer 40k lore, the Chaos Gods were born in this order:

Khorne (first - born from warfare and bloodshed)
Nurgle (second - born from despair and plague)
Tzeentch (third - born from ambition and sorcery)
Slaanesh (last - born from the Fall of the Eldar, around M30)
So chronologically arranged on your wall:

Row 1 (Top):

Spot 10: Khorne (1st born) - top-left
Spot 13: Nurgle (2nd born) - top-right
Row 3 (Bottom):

Spot 10: Tzeentch (3rd born) - bottom-left
Spot 13: Slaanesh (4th born) - bottom-right
This creates a reading order: top-left → top-right → bottom-left → bottom-right, following their chronological emergence into the Warp!

Does that work better for you?

lets go with this order feel mre confortable with it   
Row 1 (Top):

Spot 10: Khorne (top-left)
Spot 13: Tzeentch (top-right)

Row 3 (Bottom):

Spot 10: Nurgle (bottom-left)
Spot 13: Slaanesh (bottom-right)

Perfect! Sticking with the traditional Chaos wheel arrangement:

Row 1 (Top):

Spot 10: Khorne (top-left)
Spot 13: Tzeentch (top-right)
Row 3 (Bottom):

Spot 10: Nurgle (bottom-left)
Spot 13: Slaanesh (bottom-right)
This is the classic opposing pairs setup:

Khorne vs Slaanesh (rage/honor vs excess/pleasure) - diagonal
Tzeentch vs Nurgle (change/hope vs stagnation/despair) - diagonal
Great choice! Now, what about those final 4 center spots?

Row 1: Spots 11-12 Row 3: Spots 11-12

These are perfectly positioned between your Primarchs and the Chaos Gods. What would you like to put there?

why did i not think of it before tyranids, tau, elder, necrons

PERFECT! The major Xenos threats! That's brilliant - you're showing the full scope of threats to the Imperium and humanity.

So the final 4 spots:

Row 1 (Top):

Spot 11: Xenos faction
Spot 12: Xenos faction
Row 3 (Bottom):

Spot 11: Xenos faction
Spot 12: Xenos faction
Now, which Xenos where?

Some thematic options:

By threat level/age:

Top: Necrons (oldest) & Eldar (ancient)
Bottom: Tyranids (extragalactic) & Tau (youngest)
By opposition type:

Top: Tyranids & Necrons (existential threats)
Bottom: Eldar & Tau (ideological/territorial threats)
By galaxy position/expansion:

Mix them based on where they commonly fight
What feels right to you? Or do you have a preference for which Xenos go on top vs bottom?

perfect the By threat level/age:
* Top: Necrons (oldest) & Eldar (ancient)
* Bottom: Tyranids (extragalactic) & Tau (youngest)

Excellent choice! So here's your COMPLETE WALL LAYOUT:

ROW 1 (TOP) - 13 spots: 1-9: Primarchs I-X 10: Khorne 11: Necrons 12: Eldar 13: Tzeentch

ROW 2 (MIDDLE) - 13 spots: 1: Inquisition 2: Sisters of Battle 3: Sisters of Silence 4: Constantin Valdor 5: THE EMPEROR 6: Malcador the Sigillite 7: Tech Priest (Mechanicus) 8: Grey Knights 9: Assassin (Vindicare) 10: Assassin (Callidus) 11: Assassin (Eversor) 12: Assassin (Culexus) 13: Emperor-class Titan

ROW 3 (BOTTOM) - 13 spots: 1-9: Primarchs XII-XX 10: Nurgle 11: Tyranids 12: Tau 13: Slaanesh

This tells the complete story: The Emperor and his forces in the center, his sons above and below, with the ancient threats of Chaos and Xenos framing everything.

That's going to be an EPIC wall display! 🔥

next i have 2 walls seperate each has 4 rows of 2 spots

Nice! So you have two separate walls, each with 4 rows × 2 spots = 8 A4 posters per wall = 16 total spots.

These could be perfect for themed displays! Some ideas:

Wall Pairing Options:
Option 1: Loyalist vs Traitor

Wall 1: Loyalist chapters/successors/heroes
Wall 2: Traitor legions/warbands/champions
Option 2: Imperial vs Xenos/Chaos

Wall 1: More Imperial factions (Guard regiments, Knight houses, etc.)
Wall 2: More Xenos races or Chaos warbands
Option 3: Specialist Forces

Wall 1: Space Marine chapters (8 founding/successor chapters)
Wall 2: Imperial Guard regiments or other Imperial forces
Option 4: Thematic Pairs

Each row of 2 could be opposing forces (loyalist chapter + their traitor counterpart)
Option 5: Timeline/Eras

Wall 1: Great Crusade era
Wall 2: 41st Millennium/modern era
Option 6: Major Battles/Campaigns

Each pair represents key conflicts or campaigns
What theme appeals to you? Or do you have specific factions/units you want to showcase on these walls?

there  is this traitor primarch set of images 6 of them that is fulgrom, angron, magnus, mortarion, lorgar and perturabo, i really like it its a set so it fill the wall on the right leaving the bottom 2 spots

i can give to the 2 remaining assasin temples so that leaves one wall

Perfect! So Wall 1 (Right) is sorted:

WALL 1 (RIGHT) - 4 rows × 2:

Rows 1-3 (spots 1-6): The Traitor Primarch set

Fulgrim
Angron
Magnus
Mortarion
Lorgar
Perturabo
Row 4 (bottom 2 spots):

Venenum Assassin (poison/toxin specialists)
Vanus Assassin (info-warfare/sabotage)
That completes the Officio Assassinorum temples since you have the main 4 on your main wall!

Now for Wall 2 (Left) - 8 empty spots, some ideas:

Option 1: Loyalist Primarch counterparts (to mirror the traitors)

Could do 6 loyalists + 2 other figures
Option 2: Major Space Marine Chapters

8 iconic chapters (Blood Angels successors, Ultramarines successors, etc.)
Option 3: Imperial Guard Regiments

Cadian, Catachan, Krieg, Tallarn, Vostroyan, Mordian, etc.
Option 4: Chaos Champions/Notable figures

Abaddon, Typhus, Ahriman, Kharn, Lucius, Erebus, etc.
What vibe do you want for that left wall?

Abaddon, Typhus, Ahriman, Kharn, Lucius, Erebus, etc.
i could actually do this for kharn

Excellent choice! Chaos Champions would be perfect to complement the Traitor Primarchs wall!

WALL 2 (LEFT) - 4 rows × 2:

Here's a solid lineup of the most iconic Chaos champions:

Abaddon the Despoiler (Warmaster of Chaos, Black Legion)
Khârn the Betrayer (Champion of Khorne, World Eaters)
Ahriman (Arch-Sorcerer of Tzeentch, Thousand Sons)
Typhus (Herald of Nurgle, Death Guard)
Lucius the Eternal (Champion of Slaanesh, Emperor's Children)
Erebus (Dark Apostle, Word Bearers - the one who started it all)
Fabius Bile (Clonelord, renegade Apothecary)
Honsou (Warsmith, Iron Warriors)
Or you could swap in:

Huron Blackheart (Red Corsairs)
Sevatar/Sevetar (Night Lords First Captain)
Kor Phaeron (Word Bearers)
Zardu Layak (Word Bearers)
This gives you the legendary champions representing each of the major traitor legions and Chaos Gods!

Does this lineup work for you, or want to swap anyone?

or 4 by 4 down the length of my best champions on both sides

OH THAT'S EVEN BETTER!

So you're thinking:

WALL 1 (RIGHT) - Traitor/Chaos Champions: 4 champions per row × 4 rows = 16 Chaos champions

WALL 2 (LEFT) - Loyalist Champions: 4 champions per row × 4 rows = 16 Imperial/Loyalist champions

This would be an epic face-off display!

Let me help you build the lists:

WALL 1 - CHAOS CHAMPIONS (16):
Traitor Legion Champions:

Abaddon the Despoiler (Black Legion/Sons of Horus)
Khârn the Betrayer (World Eaters)
Ahriman (Thousand Sons)

Huron Blackheart (Red Corsairs)
Alpharius/Omegon operative (Alpha Legion)
Zardu Layak (Word Bearers)

OR mix in:

Custodes heroes (Valdor, Trajann Valoris)
Imperial Guard legends (Yarrick, Creed, Gaunt)
Inquisitors (Eisenhorn, Ravenor, Greyfax)
Sister of Battle heroes (Celestine)
What balance do you want for the

no wall 1 is done am talking about wall 2 like spot 1 or spot 2 of each row be a side like sigismud and kharn etc downwards i can even interchange

AH! Now I get it!

WALL 2 (LEFT) setup:

Each row has 2 spots - one for a Loyalist champion and one for their Chaos counterpart/rival. Reading down each column vertically!

Left Column (Spot 1) - Loyalist Champions:
Row 1: Sigismund (Imperial Fists) Row 2: Dante (Blood Angels) Row 3: Bjorn the Fell-Handed (Space Wolves) Row 4: Azrael (Dark Angels)

Right Column (Spot 2) - Chaos Champions:
Row 1: Khârn (World Eaters) Row 2: Lucius (Emperor's Children) Row 3: Ahriman (Thousand Sons) Row 4: Typhus (Death Guard)

OR you could do thematic rivalries:

Row 1: Sigismund vs Abaddon (both Warmasters/Champions) Row 2: Corbulo/Dante vs Lucius (perfection vs corruption) Row 3: Bjorn vs Typhus (endurance legends) Row 4: Grimaldus vs Khârn (righteous fury vs bloodlust)

You can totally mix and match! What pairings feel right to you? Direct opposites, or more thematic rivals?

no its just those i like or are just beasts like for chaos Khârn, Abaddon, for the loyalist sigismund, car charadons chapter master

by the was it doent have to be hh characters, this can also allow me to remove and add showing my preference at the time

Ah perfect! So it's just your personal "Hall of Badasses" - the characters YOU think are absolute beasts, regardless of era or specific matchups!

WALL 2 (LEFT) - Your Favorite Champions:

Spot 1 (Loyalists):

Row 1: Sigismund
Row 2: Tyberos the Red Wake (Carcharodons Chapter Master)
Row 3: [Your choice]
Row 4: [Your choice]
Spot 2 (Chaos):

Row 1: Khârn the Betrayer
Row 2: Abaddon the Despoiler
Row 3: [Your choice]
Row 4: [Your choice]
And yeah, the beauty of this setup is you can swap posters in and out as your favorites change or you discover new absolute units!

Some other beast-tier suggestions:

Loyalist side:

Asterion Moloc (Minotaurs)
Grimaldus (Black Templars)
Logan Grimnar (Space Wolves)
Vulkan He'stan (Salamanders)
Gabriel Seth (Flesh Tearers)
Chaos side:

Typhus
Sevatar
Huron Blackheart

3	Logan Grimnar	Sevatar
4	Amit	Lucius the Eternal
TOTAL: 55 A4 posters across 3 walls

Good luck with your epic display! 🔥

Rows 1-3 (6 posters):
Traitor Primarch Art Set:
* Fulgrim
* Angron
* Magnus
* Mortarion
* Lorgar
* Perturabo

what order should i use?

Great question! Here are some ordering options for the Traitor Primarch set:

Option 1: By Legion Number (Canonical)
Row 1: Fulgrim (III) & Angron (XII)
Row 2: Magnus (XV) & Mortarion (XIV)
Row 3: Lorgar (XVII) & Perturabo (IV)
Option 2: By Chaos God Allegiance
Row 1: Fulgrim (Slaanesh) & Angron (Khorne)
Row 2: Magnus (Tzeentch) & Mortarion (Nurgle)
Row 3: Lorgar (Chaos Undivided) & Perturabo (Chaos Undivided)
Option 3: By Fall Timeline (Who fell when)
Row 1: Lorgar (first to fall) & Fulgrim (early corruption)
Row 2: Angron (already damned) & Magnus (forced by Russ)
Row 3: Mortarion (reluctant) & Perturabo (bitterness)
Option 4: Aesthetic/Visual Balance
Depends on the actual images - you'd want to balance colors, poses, and visual weight.

My recommendation: Option 2 (Chaos God pairing) - it mirrors your main wall's Chaos God corner placement and tells a clear thematic story.

Which feels right to you?

what about by relations ships like abgron and lorgar, fulgrim and perturabo, magnus and mortaerion

Excellent choice! Relationship pairings make for great storytelling:

By Relationships:
Row 1: Angron & Lorgar

Lorgar "saved" Angron at Nuceria
Complex dynamic: Lorgar's faith vs Angron's rage
Lorgar saw Angron as a martyr figure
Row 2: Fulgrim & Perturabo

Close friends during the Great Crusade
Perturabo confided in Fulgrim
Tragic that Fulgrim's fall isolated Perturabo further
Row 3: Magnus & Mortarion

Bitter rivals over sorcery/psykers
Mortarion hated Magnus' use of the warp
Both ultimately fell to the powers they thought they controlled
This creates three distinct relationship dynamics:

Devotion/Salvation (Angron & Lorgar)
Friendship/Trust (Fulgrim & Perturabo)
Rivalry/Hypocrisy (Magnus & Mortarion)
Really nice narrative flow! Which side should each go on (left vs right spot)?

ok what about row order and spot order

Good question! Let me suggest an order:

Row Order (Top to Bottom):
Row 1: Fulgrim & Perturabo (Friendship)

Start with the tragic friendship story
Row 2: Angron & Lorgar (Devotion/Salvation)

The dramatic "save" at Nuceria in the middle
Row 3: Magnus & Mortarion (Rivalry)

End with the bitter enemies who both fell
Spot Order (Left vs Right):
Option A - By Fall Order:
Left spot: Earlier corruption
Right spot: Later/reluctant fall
Row 1: Fulgrim (left - early fall) | Perturabo (right - later) Row 2: Lorgar (left - first traitor) | Angron (right - already damned) Row 3: Magnus (left - broken/forced) | Mortarion (right - reluctant)

Option B - Visual Hierarchy:
Left spot: The "leader" or dominant personality
Right spot: The complementary figure
Row 1: Fulgrim (left - charismatic) | Perturabo (right - withdrawn) Row 2: Lorgar (left - manipulator) | Angron (right - weapon) Row 3: Magnus (left - proud) | Mortarion (right - bitter)

Which logic appeals to you more?

i hav decided fulgrim - perturabo
agron -lorger
morterion - magnus

Perfect! So your WALL 1 (RIGHT) Traitor Primarch layout is:

WALL 1 (RIGHT) - 2 wide × 4 tall
Row 1:

Spot 1: Fulgrim
Spot 2: Perturabo
Row 2:

Spot 1: Angron
Spot 2: Lorgar
Row 3:

Spot 1: Mortarion
Spot 2: Magnus
Row 4:

Spot 1: Venenum Assassin
Spot 2: Vanus Assassin
Nice flow! You've got:

The tragic friendship (Fulgrim/Perturabo)
The devotion/rage dynamic (Angron/Lorgar)
The bitter psyker rivals (Mortarion/Magnus)
Finishing with the final two Assassin temples at the bottom.

Solid lineup! 🔥

for wall 2 i will go Abaddon - Sigismund
Tyberos  - Khârn
Ahrim  - Logan 
Amit  - Sevatar

Awesome lineup! Here's your updated WALL 2 (LEFT):

WALL 2 (LEFT) - Hall of Champions - 2 wide × 4 tall
Row 1:

Spot 1: Abaddon the Despoiler
Spot 2: Sigismund
Row 2:

Spot 1: Tyberos the Red Wake
Spot 2: Khârn the Betrayer
Row 3:

Spot 1: Ahriman
Spot 2: Logan Grimnar
Row 4:

Spot 1: Amit
Spot 2: Sevatar
Great dynamics here:

Warmaster vs First Emperor's Champion (legendary duel)
Silent Terror vs Endless Slaughter (brutal efficiency vs rage)
Sorcerer Supreme vs Old Wolf (cunning magic vs raw veteran power)
Rage Incarnate vs Prince of Crows (two different flavors of brutality)
Perfect mix of rivalries and contrasts! That completes all your walls. 🔥

in fact if iron hands had more lore i could have gone with the chpater master in place of logan

Totally agree! The Iron Hands Chapter Master would've been a perfect fit, especially as a counterpoint to Ahriman - the cold logic and flesh-is-weak philosophy vs the sorcerous pursuit of knowledge.

The problem is:

Kardan Stronos (most recent Chapter Master in lore) - not nearly as iconic or fleshed out
Iron Father Feirros - more well-known but still limited lore
The Chapter Council system makes it less clear-cut
The Iron Hands really got shafted in terms of character development compared to Space Wolves, Blood Angels, etc.

Alternative Iron Hands options if you ever want to swap:

Ferrus Manus himself (if you want the Primarch over successors)
Gabriel Santar (First Captain during Heresy - "Either" - more lore)
Shadrak Meduson (Heresy-era hero, Shattered Legions)
But yeah, Logan makes way more sense given the lore depth. Iron Hands deserved better! 🦾

If they ever give the Iron Hands a proper character spotlight, you can easily swap Logan out since it's modular. That's the beauty of your setup!

thanks i will be printing soon

Awesome! That's going to be an epic display when it's all up! 🔥

You've got:

Main wall: The full Imperial might with the Emperor at the center
Wall 1: The Traitor Primarchs with meaningful pairings
Wall 2: Your personal Hall of Badasses
55 posters total telling the whole Warhammer 40k story!

Quick printing tips:

Make sure your A4 prints are consistent quality/finish
Consider laminating or using photo paper for durability
Test your layout spacing before committing all the adhesive
Good luck with the printing and mounting! Would love to know how it turns out. The Emperor protects! ⚔️

i dont know if i add a change i would put row 1 and 3's spot 10 and 11 to spot 1 and 2

Interesting! So you're thinking of repositioning on the main wall:

Current layout:

Row 1: Primarchs I-IX (spots 1-9), then Khorne (10), Necrons (11), Eldar (12), Tzeentch (13)
Row 3: Primarchs XII-XX (spots 1-9), then Nurgle (10), Tyranids (11), Tau (12), Slaanesh (13)
Your proposed change: Move spots 10-11 to spots 1-2, shifting everything:

Row 1: Khorne (1), Necrons (2), Primarchs I-IX (spots 3-11), Eldar (12), Tzeentch (13)
Row 3: Nurgle (1), Tyranids (2), Primarchs XII-XX (spots 3-11), Tau (12), Slaanesh (13)
This would: ✅ Create a "box frame" effect - threats on ALL four edges (spots 1, 2, 12, 13) ✅ Primarchs more centered/protected ✅ More symmetrical threat positioning

But: ❌ Breaks the Chaos Gods perfect corner placement ❌ Less visual separation between Primarchs and threats

My take: The current corner layout (spots 10 & 13) is cleaner and more dramatic, but the "full frame" approach has merit too!

What's making you consider the change? Aesthetic or thematic reasons?

but see then i would push the emperor from 5 to 7

OH NOW I SEE IT! That changes everything!

New Layout with Emperor at Spot 7:

ROW 1:
Khorne
Necrons 3-11. Primarchs I-IX
Eldar
Tzeentch
ROW 2:
Inquisition
Sisters of Battle
Sisters of Silence
Constantin Valdor
Malcador the Sigillite
Tech Priest
THE EMPEROR ← NEW CENTER
Grey Knights
Vindicare Assassin
Callidus Assassin
Eversor Assassin
Culexus Assassin
Emperor-class Titan
ROW 3:
Nurgle
Tyranids 3-11. Primarchs XII-XX
Tau
Slaanesh
What this does: ✅ Emperor is now at the TRUE mathematical center of the 13-wide wall (spot 7) ✅ Creates perfect symmetry: 6 spots on each side of the Emperor ✅ Full "threat frame" - all four corners + edges occupied ✅ Valdor and Malcador are now immediately flanking the Emperor (spots 4-5 and 6) ✅ More balanced visual weight

This is actually brilliant! The Emperor truly centered with his inner circle closest. Do you want to go with this version?
